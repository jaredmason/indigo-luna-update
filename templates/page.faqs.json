We have no control over border force agencies in any country and cannot intervene in their clearance processes. If the customs agency requires any information, documentation or payment of any duty\/tax fees, they will contact you directly to advise this and provide further information on how to arrange clearance. If you have not received any correspondence from the customs agency, please contact your local customs directly before getting in touch with us.<\/p>",

Please think about utilising a full load and using your grey water wisely and plant-based detergents are best. Air dry flat or hang out to dry, do not machine dry. <\/p><p>Plant Dyed garments must be gently hand-washed in cold water. Make sure to use a natural, delicate soap. Do not put the garment in direct contact with the soap or powder, it's better to make the water soapy. Do not use Soap Berries, as a natural active ingredient may cause the natural dye to run. <\/p><p>Place the garment into the water and give it a gentle swirl wash.  Drain the water into a nearby plant and refill with clean, cold water. Rinse your garment by swishing it around a few more times, and then gently press it to remove excess water. Try not to wring or twist, as this can distort its shape and cause extra stress on our plant-based dye.  Finally, reshape the garment, and lay it flat on a drying rack or on a fresh towel to air dry.<\/p><p>Try to avoid strong chemicals such as bleach and citrus juice.<\/p><p>Please try to avoid direct sunlight as the natural dyes tend to fade when left alone the sun for long periods of time.<\/p><p>Steaming\/ironing can be done on a low setting, just take extra care.<\/p>",
